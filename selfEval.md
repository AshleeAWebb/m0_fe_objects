# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
The console not working properly but it came down to one small error that I was over looking.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
I feel that I need to organize my notes better at the beginning of the week I felt very organized and as we wrap up I feel like things are getting a little chaotic. I think I will schedule additonal time to review notes and organize my replits, githubs, and local VS Code files so I have examples to refer to if i get stuck. I feel that I take the most helpful notes during live sessions.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
Solving on my own at times the googling will lead me futher off the path as there is so much information that I am yet to understand.
